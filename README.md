# Surfs Up

## Overview of the Analysis

The purpose of the analysis was to provide W. Avy and the board of directors with processed data about the temperatures in Oahu to support the decision to open a new surf shop. Specifically, there will be a direct comparison between the results of the months of December and June to better understand if the surf shop and ice cream business is sustainable all year.

## Results

- The weather data from June is not severely different than the one from December; although there are more weather observations in June.
- There were **1700** observations in June and **1,517** in December, which might explain why the standard deviation is slightly higher in December,
- The average temperature per day is also quite similar with only a **3.9** degree difference.
- Even though the tempeartures are similar, it is important to note that the range of these is higher in December. The lowest was **56** while the highest **83**. In contrast, June has a range of only **21**.
- The following image will be able to give a clear snapshot of the main differences between the summary statistics of June and December:
